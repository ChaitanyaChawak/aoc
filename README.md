Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.

TODO
- turn into package format to allow for arbitrary imports
- add functionality to fetch dataset automatically from utils/
- add func. to parse dataset, also in utils/
- proposed format : two functions, one solving part 1, other solving part 2

NOTE
- data is same for both parts, but data is unique to a user
- 

GOALS
- try coming up with more direct array operations
